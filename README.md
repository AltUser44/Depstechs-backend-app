**Full-Stack E-Commerce Website using MERN Stack**

This project showcases the power of full-stack development by building a complete e-commerce website from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It comes with advanced features like category filtering, a dynamic shopping cart, secure Stripe payment integration, and order tracking. I’ve also built both user and admin dashboards. Users can manage orders, leave reviews, and update their profiles, while admins have the tools to manage inventory, products, orders, and users with visual data displayed through intuitive charts.

#Key Features:

MERN Stack: A complete e-commerce site built with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
\
Advanced E-commerce Functionality: Category filtering, shopping cart calculations, Stripe payment integration.

User & Admin Dashboards: Manage orders, products, users, and view visual data on performance.

Real-World Security: JWT authentication, password hashing, and middleware integration to secure the app.

Deployment: Learn how to deploy and maintain the app on Vercel.

This project is perfect for aspiring full-stack developers, entrepreneurs, and students who want to build scalable, secure web applications and learn how to create a fully functional e-commerce platform.
